# Classroom-Attendance-using-Face-Detection-using-RaspberryPi
A lot of productive time is wasted when the attendance of the class is taken manually. So, I present a better approach of knowing the class attendance using a facial recognition system that would recognize the student during the class without wasting much of the time. A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. As face is the primary identification for any human, my system would recognize each student using face as the feature for recognition. The system would automatically update the student’s presence in the class to the student’s database and send messages to guardians of absentees and also to the HOD.
